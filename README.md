# FoundationDB, RocksDB Simulation Tester (FRoST)

FoundationDB is one of the progenitors of deterministic simulation testing (DST). Here we evaluate DST as implemented by FoundationDB against a similar DST implementation by TigerBeetleDB, and evaluate DST on other key-value databases such as RocksDB, Cassandra and Valkey.
